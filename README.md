# MonkeyFinder

**MonkeyFinder** is a .NET MAUI test application based on the source code from **James Montemagno**â€™s video course:  
[**Learn .NET MAUI - Full Course for Beginners | Build cross-platform apps in C#**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuNLR_NJv8U)

The monkey data is sourced from James Montemagnoâ€™s [official JSON file](https://montemagno.com/monkeys.json).

Entering and exiting geofence icons were originally taken from [Iconduck](https://iconduck.com/) in SVG format. They were then converted to Android Vector format.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

This project was created for educational purposes. Specifically, to:

1. Learn the fundamentals of building cross-platform applications with **.NET MAUI**
2. Explore and understand how to implement **geofencing** functionality on **Android** and **iOS**
